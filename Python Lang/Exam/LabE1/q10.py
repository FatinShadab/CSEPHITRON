10. Given a string ‘s’ you need to find the words that are in list ‘a’ and use the next words on
string ‘s’ to create a new string. Save it inside a file called ‘out.txt’. Remember to close the
file after writing.
Write a function named create_new_string() and write your code inside this function.
Example:

a = ['oh', 'Emelia', 'to']

s = "Oh, I got two tickets for Dhaka. I and Emelia love to visit
different places very much. This time we are going to Bangladesh."

output = "I love Bangladesh" (inside a file)
