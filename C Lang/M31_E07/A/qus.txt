An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. To create an array in C, we can do int arr[n];. Here, arr, is a variable array which holds up to integers. The above array is a static array that has memory allocated at compile time.

In this challenge, create an array of size n , and read the values. Iterate the array calculating the sum of all elements. Print the sum.

While it is true that you can sum the elements as they are read, without first storing them to an array, but you will not get the experience working with an array. Efficiency will be required later.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, n .
The next line contains space-separated integers.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 1000

1 <= arr[i] <= 1000



Output Format

Print the sum of the integers in the array.
