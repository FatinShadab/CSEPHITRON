Given an array aa of nn elements, print any value that appears at least three times or print -1 if there is no such value.

Input

The first line contains an integer tt (1 \leq t \leq 10^41≤t≤10 
4
 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer nn (1 \leq n \leq 2\cdot10^51≤n≤2⋅10 
5
 ) — the length of the array.

The second line of each test case contains nn integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_na 
1
​
 ,a 
2
​
 ,…,a 
n
​
  (1 \leq a_i \leq n1≤a 
i
​
 ≤n) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot10^52⋅10 
5
 .

Output

For each test case, print any value that appears at least three times or print -1 if there is no such value.
