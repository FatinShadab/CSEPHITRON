Ashiq doesn't love strings. But he really likes letter 'a'. He assumes a string beautiful if more than half of it's character are 'a'. For example some beautiful strings are "baaba", "a", "aqawa" , but "abb", "waeaia" are not.
As Ashiq only loves beautiful strings, so he wanted to erase some character (possibly zero) from the string s such that the string become longest beautiful string. So he wants to know what will be the size of longest string remaining after erase some character( possibly zero) to get a beautiful string.
It is guaranteed that the string will consist of atleast one 'a'. So answer always exists.

Input
==============
The first line contains a string s ( 1 <= |s| <= 50 ) consist of only lower case English letters. And it is guaranteed that there is at least one 'a' in string s ;

Output
==============
Print a single line, the length of the longest beautiful string that Ashiq can get after erasing some character ( possibly zero ) from string s.

Examples
===============

Input :
yayayya
Output :
5

Input :
aa
Output :
2

Note
=================
In the first example we can erase any two 'y' from that string it will be a beautiful string of longest length which is 5.
In the second example we don't need to erase any character from that string as it is already a beautiful string, so the answer is 2.
