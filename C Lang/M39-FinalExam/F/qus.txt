Square1001 has seen an electric bulletin board displaying the integer 11. He can perform the following operations A and B to change this value:

Operation A: The displayed value is doubled.
Operation B: The displayed value increases by KK.
Square1001 needs to perform these operations NN times in total. Find the minimum possible value displayed in the board after NN operations.

Constraints
1 \leq N, K \leq 101≤N,K≤10
All input values are integers.
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

The value will be minimized when the operations are performed in the following order: A, A, B, B.
In this case, the value will change as follows: 11 → 22 → 44 → 77 → 1010.
