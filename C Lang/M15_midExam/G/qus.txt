PROBLEM
---------
Tania and Pao are training for the next ICPC season but they have decided to rest, for that reason Tania created a 
game where she guesses the strings that Paola made for her.

At first, Paola came up with the secret string A consisting of lowercase English letters. The string A has a length
 of 2 or more characters. Then, from string A she builds a new string B and offers Tania the string B so that she 
 can guess the string A.

Paola builds B from A as follows: she writes all the substrings of length 2 of the string A in the order from left to
 right, and then joins them in the same order into the string B.

For example, if Paola came up with the string A="bcdaf", then all the substrings of length 2 of the string A are: 
"bc", "cd", "da","af". Therefore, the string B="bccddaaf".

You are given the string B. Help Tania to guess the string A that Paola came up with. It is guaranteed that B was 
built according to the algorithm given above. It can be proved that the answer to the problem is unique.

INPUT
----------
The first line contains a single positive integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases in the test. Then t test 
cases follow. Each test case consists of one line in which the string B is written, consisting of lowercase English 
letters (2≤|B|≤100) — the string Paola came up with, where |B| is the length of the string B. It is guaranteed that 
B was built according to the algorithm given above.

OUTPUT
-----------
Output t answers to test cases. Each answer is the secret string A, consisting of lowercase English letters, that
Paola came up with.
