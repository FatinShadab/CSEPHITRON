PROBLEM
-------------
Good numbers are the positive integers whose decimal representations contain only the good digits 4 and 7. 
For example, numbers 4747, 74, 4 are good and 5, 157, 4657 are not.

Unfortunately, not all numbers are good. Petya calls a number nearly good if the number of good digits in it is 
a good number. He wonders whether number n is a nearly good number.

INPUT
-------------
The only line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1018).

Please do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit numbers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, 
cout streams or the %I64d specificator.

OUTPUT
-------------
Print on the single line "YES" if n is a nearly good number. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).

EXAMPLES
---------

case 1:

    Input
    --------
    40047

    Output
    ---------
    NO

case 2:

    Input
    --------
    7747774

    Output
    --------
    YES

case 3:

    Input
    --------
    1000000000000000000

    Output
    ---------
    NO

NOTE
-------------

In the first sample there are 3 good digits (first one and last two), so the answer is "NO".

In the second sample there are 7 good digits, 7 is good number, so the answer is "YES".

In the third sample there are no good digits, so the answer is "NO".
