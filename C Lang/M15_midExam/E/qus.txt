PROBLEM
----------
Rick is creating a new device, and to test it he needs a special string. A string is called special if it contains 
all the letters of the alphabet, either in lowercase or uppercase.

You are given a string, print "YES" (without quotes) if it's special and "NO" otherwise.

INPUT
----------
The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of characters in the string.

The second line contains the string. The string consists only of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.

OUTPUT
----------
Output "YES" if the string contains all the letters of the alphabet, and "NO" otherwise.
