PROBLEM
----------------
PLUR is a well-known motto at electronic music festivals that stands for "Peace Love Unity Respect". All people who 
believe in PLUR should wear very colorful kandies to distribute PLUR throughout the festival.

Your friend Santirax is going to EDC for the first time and wants to bring the most colorful kandies from the entire 
festival, but he have a problem: He only has red, green and blue bead. You as his friend, will help him to create the most colorful kandie as possible.

Santirax will give you N beads in a certain order and asked you not to change that order. You can only remove beads 
to make a colorful kandie. A kandie is colorful if for any bead, its adjacent beads are of a different color.

Since the kandies go on the wrist of your hand, you want the bracelet to be as long as possible, therefore you will 
have to remove as few beads as possible to make a colorful kandie.

INPUT
----------------
The first line contains integer  — the number of beads on the table.
The next line contains string , which represents the colors of the beads. We'll consider the beads in the row 
numbered from  to  from left to right. Then the  character  equals "R", if the  bead is red, "G", if it's green and 
"B", if it's blue.

OUTPUT
----------------
Print a single integer — the minimum number of beads to remove in order to make the kandie colorful.
